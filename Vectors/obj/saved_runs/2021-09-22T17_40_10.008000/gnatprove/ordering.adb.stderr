ordering.adb:49:35: medium: loop invariant might fail in first iteration (e.g. when Table = (0 => -2, 1 => -1, others => 0) and Table'First = 0 and Table'Last = 1 and pivot = -1)[#1]
ordering.adb:49:35: medium: loop invariant might not be preserved by an arbitrary iteration (e.g. when Table = (2 => -1, others => -2) and Table'First = 0 and Table'Last = 2 and pivot = -1)[#2]
ordering.adb:49:81: medium: array index check might fail (e.g. when Table'First = 0 and pivot = -1)[#0]
ordering.ads:39:16: medium: postcondition might fail (e.g. when Table = (others => 0) and Table'First = 0 and Table'Last = 0) [possible explanation: loop at ordering.adb:36 should mention Table in a loop invariant][#3]
